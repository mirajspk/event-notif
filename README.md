# Development Instructions

1. **Avoid working on `main`!** Create a new branch for your feature.  
   *This keeps the `main` branch stable and free of incomplete changes.*

2. **Push your branch** to GitHub.  
   *This shares your work with the team and keeps the project up to date.*

3. **Create a pull request** when you're finished.  
   *This allows the team to review your work before merging it into `main`.*

This ensures the project stays organized and everyone can collaborate smoothly.
